This will make our model biased towards signs with higher image counts and maybe it wont be able to correctly classify signs with counts below 300 all the time."

    "\n",
    "#### Histogram Equalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram equalization is a technique that transforms the image to a more bright if it was dark and vise versa, this technique maps image pixels from one end of the spectrum (bright or dark) to the full range of the image. This equalization makes sure that the image makes use of its full light spectrum (contrast) so images appear more clear, it gives us uniform lighting over all of the image pixels. It does this by equalizing all pixel intensities to with the global image intensity.\n",

    "![histogram_equalization.png](./assets/histogram_equalization.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of our images now appear clearer especially the low lit and low contrast ones, but in the process of lighting these images up we sacrificed some of their features. Some of the images lost their definition, thats why we then applied the Adaptive Histogram Equalization which should deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CALHE)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the Adaptive version of the Histogram equalization Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization CALHE for short, which limits the contrast applied to each pixels by its neighboring pixels, so pixels cant be affected by really bright or dim pixels that are not even near them. This technique needs a filter or a grid size of how far from a pixel should we consider neighbors, in our implementation we chose a `3x3` grid size due to our  small image size.\n",
    "\n",
    "![calhe.png](./assets/calhe.png)\n",

We tuned our threshold several times first we started with the distribution's mean which was **810**, but the data generated wasn't enough for low count classes, then with some trial and error we got the best results using the value mentioned above.\n",

    "So by doing so we now have a more uniform distribution and close to equal image representation that should eliminate the huge bias that  we first had in our data. This new distribution has a *mean* of **1,649** more than twice the original **810**, and **Go straight or left** now has **1,601** images so does most of the classes. This increased the class with the lowest number **181** to **1,601** a 9 fold increase of meaningful image variation, apart from solving our imbalanced distribution problem this increased our **training** dataset from **34,799** to **70,879** thats more than twice our original dataset size. These two new improvements that resulted from our approach to data augmentation will give us a more robust classifier.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we said before normalization or standardization is a process of range binding our image data to low float values like [-1,1] to *mathematically optimize* our data and make it easy for our machine to execute hardware intensive operations on such a huge number of data. So after we were done with all of the other preprocessing operations we applied *global mean* standardization on all of our datasets(training, validation, and testing) using the *mean* and *standard deviation* of the new **CALHE** augmented images. Then we fed our datasets to the model that we're going to talk about in the next section.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "I used my personal PC to train, evaluate, and test the model, I used `Tensorflow-GPU` which ran on an **NVIDIA GTX 980-ti** which is a decently fast *GPU* for training the model and its still good at games. Though the *GPU* is tough and performs  fast operation, however, training took a long time some of which too up to `3` hours(augmented RGBG).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model HyperParameters\n",
    "\n",
    "A model's hyperparameters are the way we tune and manage how are model performs, and its essential that they get set correctly in order for the model to give its optimal performance. We set and played around with alot of parameter in this project and for the nature of its complexity it took days to train the model on different variations which we'll be seeing in the section below, but here are the hyperparameters that we tuned in the course of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Batch size:** I started with a batch size of `128` which is kind of the default for most machines, but it takes more time to train especially after applying augmentation. So I ran tried and tested on different multiples `256`, `512`, then stopped at `1024` cause I felt that it was fast enough and didn't want to compromise the **mini- batch SGD** and overfit. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Epochs:** At the start I used `30 epoch` which is funny when I look back at it, then when I started adding more depth, lower learning rate, and dropout to my network it became clear that I needed a bigger number so I went with `50` then `100`, `500`, `1000`, and even `2000` which takes 3.5 hours to train. mainly I used lower number of epoch like `100` or `500` to validate variation of parameters that I was testing then I used the heavy hitters `1000`, and `2000` to get the best accuracy possible, it was mainly a difference of less that `1%` but I was striving for the best accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**learning rate:** Here I started with `0.001` a low number from the get go because you can never go wrong with a low learning rate it will always converge to the (Not always), hopefully to the global minimum. However, we have to be wary of not overfitting, thats why I applied **dropout** to the network to keep the network from overfitting the training set. After some testing I even lowered the learning rate to `0.0001` which yielded better morestable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also got to played around with the *optimizer* and ultimately chose the `AdamOptimizer` which is an implementation of the [Adam algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980.pdf) of the **Stochastic Gradient decent** created by *Diederik P. Kingma*, and *Jimmy Ba*. This `tf.train.AdamOptimizer()` is better than the `tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer()` because it calculates the moving mean or **momentum** that automatically calculates the **adaptive learning rate** and increases or decreases it to get the optimal learning rate. However the algorithm takes more time due to the underlying computations, but it deals with fine tuning the learning rate to converge.\n",

I also explored different **normalization** techniques like MINMAX normalization and global mean normalization. I added **augmentation** and compared the results to the normal data before augmentation. Then I added **dropout**, changed its values, and even removed it all together from some layers. I experimented with other **non-linear activations** like leaky-relu and elu. I also tried out to combine the RGB and the CALHE layers **(RGBG)** which got me a **32x32x4** image. Below I'll be showing the result of these experiments and the results of the most successful run.\n",

    "The two variations gave close results over `100` epochs, but the real difference was obvious over more epochs where the second variation gave an increase of about `3%`. So I chose the second variation and after comparing both the **Grayscale** an the **CALHE** versions, the **CALHE** preformed better than the **Grascale** by about `2-3%` validation accuracy, which made our validation accuracy jump to `98.5%` and our training accuracy to be close to a `100%`.

    "Now we have a **deep** model, with **dropou**t, thats feeds **normalized CALHE** images and trains over `500` epoch which produces above `98%` validation accuracy. I then proceeded to apply ***relative* data augmentation** which decreased the accuracy for the first couple of epochs then slightly increased the validation accuracy. It seemed that the addition of this new augmented data which increased the training dataset size from `34,799` to `63,000` images helped our model to learn better, this showed in the slight increase of the in validation accuracy of `99%`. Now that we have really solid model that performs well on the Training and validation set we can now turn our attention to the test set.\n",

    "#### Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "After I had mostly everything in place I tried the model on testing set, which gave `96.9%` which is an amazing result and way over the required upper limit for this project. However, after looking into the augmentation pipeline I noticed that some of the methods needed some adjustments and I could add more augmentations to the images, so I added more augmentations and improved on the existing ones and now the training dataset size increased from `34,799` to `70,879`, but while the validation accuracy increased the test accuracy actually decreased to `95%`. That increase of dataset size and decrease of accuracy made me think of changing the dropout to reduce overfitting as we'll see next.\n",

    "\n",
    "We lowered the convolutional layer's dropout to `0.55` which is the lowest we'll be doing in this project, this is to prevent the network from over-fitting our training data over many epochs. The importance of **dropout** is that it helps generalize the model over the validation, test, or any example by randomly omitting 50% (the keep probability 100 - keep probability) of the layer's features by setting their weights to zeros, this helps the network to be independent of certain features and give notice to all features equally; for example, if we have a feature like rounded corners and we assign high weight to it all the time then it over shadows the other features because we're just increasing its weight without giving chance for the other features to get trained as well, but by adding a drop out we know that we give every feature a change in training which will in turn abstract some of the features that will help generalize to future edged examples per se.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![esp1.png](./assets/esp1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see here our `0.1.4` version misclassified **End of passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons** as **End of speed limit (80km/h)** which in all fairness bears a lot of similarity to, for both of them are black and white and have lines going diagonally through them.\n",
    "\n",

    "Then we tried out the `0.1.5` to see effect of these two mistrious signs:\n",
    "![esp2.png](./assets/esp2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Version `0.1.5`  does the opposite of `0.1.4` and it falsely classifies **No passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons** as **End of no passing by vehicles over 3.5 metric tons**, this  behaviour is rather peculiar because its virtually the same model with the only difference being that `0.1.5` have been trained for a couple of hundred epochs more. This suggests that each model overfit one of the signs and ignored the other, its still a very strange case that needs further investigation.\n",

    "\n",
    "![esp3.png](./assets/esp3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up choosing the `MoNet0.1.3` due to its robust classification of all test signs, in addition to its handling of this especial case that baffled the other 2 variations. This variation also gives better softmax predictions on the test images and on the **UAE** test images that we'll see below."

    "The Softmax probabilities were for the most part lack luster, most of the tests images that I ran the through the model gave near `100%` even, with others having less than an `0.1% ` for other predictions. That might reflect that our model is too sure of its results due the fact that it was trained on `70,879` over `2000` epochs, I don't know if thats a good or a bad thing cause for false classification as we'll  see in the section below it gives a very low value for the correct prediction  too.\n",

In the case of the **Traffic signals** we didn't get the correct label in any of the Softmax predictions, but we got all of the triangular signs in the top `5` predictions except for the **Traffic signals** which means that the network could identify the sign's shape but failed to classify the figure inside."

    "## Visualizing the Neural Network \n",

    "So here we have the `MoNet0.1.3` First Convolutional Layer resulting filters, we can see that the each of the 32 filters captures the curves and edges of the **Speed limit (20 km/h)**. Mainly the filters focus on the edges of the sign and the edges of the digits inside while ignoring whats outside all together. Some of the filters even capture the *graffiti* but not to a high degree, other filters like filter *17* is capturing some noisy representation of the sign. \n",

    "Here in the `second layer` we have `64` filters and a `10x10` image, as we can see its really hard to clearly identify the features captured, but we can make out some features like the sign edges like in *41* which shows the lower edges and some filters contain the digit edges as in the case of *23*.\n",

We might event still see some small resemblance to the sign's curved edges. \n"

    "First I'd like to thank you for reading and hope you learned something from this project cause I sure did. In the course of this project I've learned a lot about constructing a robust classifier and preparing its training data. I've executed many tests and looked at many graphs which gave me an understanding of how certain techniques alone or in combination with others affect the model; for example applying **normalization** helps the network learn faster, **dropout**  combined with a higher number of epochs gives better results and prevents overfitting to a degree, and **data augmentation** and the relative approach used in the project helps the network learn better and it rockets the accuracy up (well just `2-3%` but its good enough). This was a really fun project and I enjoyed working on it way much than I should cause it took me a lot of time to finish, but it was a great experience and hopefully I'll come back to it and improve a lot more upon it and get the accuracy a bit higher."

    "1. Increasing the model **test accuracy** from `98.2%`\n",

    "1. Better augmentation algorithm to increase the dataset size and still gives us a uniform dataset.\n",
    "2. Maybe in order for the **RGBG** combo to work I need to have a deeper network.\n",

    "* I'm planning to build a traffic signs recognizer and combine it with the classifier to have a fully fledged traffic signs classifier, I'm planning on doing this in a mobile app so it can be easily used for testing.\n",
    "* I'm also planning to further explore the idea and use the model on the **UAE** traffic signs and see if I can achieve closer result to the **German** traffic signs dataset.\n",
    "* I also want to try batch normalization, I already tried it many times in the project but I got very bad result, so I'll try it out again sometime in the future.\n",
